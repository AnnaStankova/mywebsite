<h1><strong> website about tigers</strong></h1>

   <p> Tigers are often looked as being one of the most beautiful yet ferocious animals and perhaps thisis a sole driving factor that makes them even more interesting creatures.
   But sadly, they have come to a verge of being categorized as endangered, thanks to the human sloppiness and prudence.
   As a wildlife lover with keen interest on large cats, I enjoy visiting wildlife sanctuaries but the question remains, how well do I or we know about this exotic animal? 
   Weâ€™re often clouded by many misconceptions with other large cat species </p>
